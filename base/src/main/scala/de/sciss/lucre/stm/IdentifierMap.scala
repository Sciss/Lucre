/** An identifier map is basically a transactional map whose keys are system identifiers.
  * However, there are two important aspects: First, the map is always ephemeral
  * (but might be still durable!), even for a confluently persistent system. Second,
  * for systems whose identifiers constitute temporal traces (confluently persistent
  * system), lookup (via `get`, `contains` etc.) finds _any_ value stored for the
  * current version or any older version. That is to say, in a confluently persistent
  * system, it looks up the most recent entry for the key. It is therefore a useful
  * tool to map system entities to ephemeral live views.
  *
  * @tparam Tx  the underlying system's transaction type
  * @tparam Id  the underlying system's identifier type
  * @tparam A   the values stored at the keys. `Unit` can be used if only set
  *             functionality is needed.
